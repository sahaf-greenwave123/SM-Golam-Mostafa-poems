    <h2>On the bank of ‘Bhairab’</h2>
   <p>
    It seems frequently to me,<br>
I go back to your tree-shaded bank<br>
Where I have spent a vast span of my life<br>
Childhood, adolescence and collections of youth.<br>
On the green grassy laps on the bank<br>
Where many catkin flowers bloomed<br>
On the dew-bathed meadow grasses at dawn<br>
I have seen dew-tears of my beloved mother.<br>
Wandering barefooted on your bank in afternoon<br>
Resting for a while under the Indian oak<br>
Down I myself threw<br>
How many flowers, buds and fruits, I hugged!<br>
Embracing your laps, that very moored paths<br>
Have run snakes away for miles after miles<br>
Hundreds and thousands of times in passage of life,<br>
I bathed in your crystal-clean water.<br>
For spending idle times with my friends<br>
I started crossing your foamy water on boards<br>
A very delightful moment came in that time<br>
As if, congregation of hearts in that rowing boat!<br>
Those very dilapidated huts of your bank<br>
Have been standing as witnesses of vast time,<br>
In those worn-out cottages lived my bosom<br>
I still sigh always for whom.<br>

N.B.: The ‘Bhairab’ is the main river of Bagerhat district of Khulna Divison in<br>
Bangladesh. This has a great influence on mind of the poet. This poem was written in<br>
commemoration of village, its memoirs and its un-resisted attractions while the poet was<br>
in the long distance of 325 km (previous distance across the curved way unlike the<br>
straightway after the year 2000) for higher education in Dhaka Varsity.<br>

   <h2>Are You Only the Wheelchair?</h2>

   <p>
    Who calls you merely a wheel chair?<br>
You, not only the wheel chair of hard steel.<br>
Indomitable power and courage lies in you.<br>
Whether you are less costly or more, auto-run or not?<br>
Plies slowly or swiftly or run by others; doesn’t matter<br>
Persons on you are the main; your honour and prestige.<br>
A part of vast disabled persons in the world,<br>
Cannot run without your direct supports<br>
But what is your value without them?<br>
The disabled has virtual dependency on you<br>
But your increased honour is due to their use<br>
Otherwise you are an inert substance of metal.<br>
I have seen a special personality of wheelchair<br>
He roams about the actions on you in ease<br>
Nothing has less to him as opposed to others.<br>
His lofty voices, oily colour and complexion<br>
Robust, stout body with vivid impression of valour<br>
Filled in profound capability, laughs with open heart.<br>
Crossing borders of the country, wanders borderless<br>
Keeping abreast of non-disabled in all respects<br>
Staying in one of the developed countries of the world.<br>
Uninterruptible flow of words, clearer accents<br>
Penetrates into ears and depth of mind tremendously<br>
Have supremacies in intelligences and consciences.<br>
So, you wheelchair; how are you inferior to others?<br>
To the high-priced cars; the so-called rich men use,<br>
If cars are not used; those will be the rusty objects.<br>
You are equally valued to the disabled by their dint<br>
Be proud of your rider(s), for which your invention<br>
By their use, you are the other name of car; not mare chair.<br>

   <h2>Whose hands are humanitarian, heart is full of love</h2>

   <p>
    Where the hands are of humanity having a great mind <br>
    You are Valery Taylor from Bakimhamsire of England,<br>
    Came to Chittagong of Bangladesh for its beauties<br>
    Kept yourself herein for a great mission of duties.<br>
    Set up the ‘Centre for Rehabilitation for the Paralyzed’<br>
    In course of time that became a peerless institute in deed.<br>
    Collected moneys for the organization in hardiness<br>
    Have worked in commitment, being relentlessly selfless;<br>
    Have immense contributions for curing the paralyzed<br>
    So we can hear from them the tale of your sublime mind.<br>
    You saw the sufferings of freedom fighters, their pangs<br>
    Have stretched your great hands for their curing(s);<br>
    Went to their inner hearts and ignited the ray of hopes<br>
    Having shun your own happiness, sought their scopes.<br>
    Used to taking scanty of moneys only for subsistence<br>
    In serving the distressed, you are the pioneer in sense.<br>
    This is not a job at all, but your great life assignments<br>
    Engaged in serving the humanity at cost of merriments.<br>
    Dedicated your youth, life for the distressed of ours<br>
    The houses of paralyzed became glowed with cheers<br>
    Came at youth, now you are at the age of oldness;<br>
    You are not afraid of anger of musclemen, hoodlums<br>
    Are not dominated or purchased by any hindrances<br>
    Providing services to the have-nots and; deprived ones;<br>
    Have small demand of foods, normal clothes for own<br>
    Thus you have made the neglected as of your bosom.<br>
    You proved that your mind is of having little prides<br>
    So all praise you - your great achievements and deeds;<br>
    You are the pride of Bangladesh, all love and; honour you<br>
    Shattered the obstacles of opponent changing the view.<br>
    May you live long! the deprived humanity gets benefits<br>
    May your goodwill spread crossing the territorial sites;<br>
    You are the Teresa of Bangladesh, win the Prize ‘Nobel’<br>
    We are waiting and longing eagerly for you with laurel.<br>
