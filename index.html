         <i><strong>United Kingdom</strong></i> 
    <h1>A Few Days in UK</h1>
    <p>
        I have come to the land of white persons,<br>
After crossing many rivers and seas,<br>
You are the land of dreams of my childhood<br>
Mother of democracy, realm of educations.<br>
The queen of Europe, attraction for travelers<br>
Unique beauty of yours, pleasing to eyes<br>
Troubles of long travels disappears soon<br>
Yours memoirs remain in mind for ever.<br>
First glimpse from the windows of plane<br>
Wreaths of lights in array, brings new thrills<br>
Houses in rows at night in London<br>
Astute craftsman has arranged this own.<br>
Caravan of vehicles plies in rows and rows<br>
Goes like swarm of ants forming the queues<br>
Little traffic congestion, all go unhampered<br>
No traffic police, yet there is no hassle.<br>
Speed is auto-controlled, auto-cameras<br>
One wanting to overtake; changes the routes<br>
Few shops and houses by the side of highways<br>
Who dares to occupy footpaths of pedestrians?<br>
Country of biting cold, lower heat of sun,<br>
Snowfalls make the lives harder to earn<br>
Potato, loaf, half-boiled - staples with drinks<br>
Unlike ours, curries mixed with tasty spices.<br>
Innumerable historic(s), hillocks and parks<br>
Goods of high prices, dearer to the poor<br>
If there pounds in the purse, lives are easier<br>
Heart triumphs when sees adherence to rules.<br>

  <h1>Better Financial Management</h1>

  <p>
    The subject of ‘Accounting’ is the ‘Language of Business’.<br>
It has ‘Double Entries’, ‘Golden Rules’ having a good base,<br>
The vouchers, books, records and documents, we have to keep;<br>
Assets are safeguarded through functions of a Stewardship.<br>
Works will be divided; some one will have the responsibility<br>
Then a particular staff accordingly will have the Accountability.<br>
Transactions are recorded considering Standards of accountancy,<br>
Stakeholders will then get information having Transparency.<br>
Retained earning is the proof of organization’s overall ability,<br>
Balance Sheet reflecting fair views; focuses on its Viability.<br>
Whenever there prevails staff’s all out propriety and honesty,<br>
Increases the organization’s credibility, goodwill and Integrity;<br>
If the standards and principles are followed maintaining accuracy<br>
Then the best practices are ensured bringing in Consistency;<br>
When all sorts of internal control mechanisms are in real practice,<br>
Accounts personnel can pass good days as if lying in great peace,<br>
Whatever the activities in hand, Finance personnel are too busy<br>
Only the best policies and its applications can make the life easy.<br>
‘Finance’ is always unpleasant but organization’s inseparable hub<br>
Act of debugging, ‘Getting the rules adhered’, and ‘A thankless job’.<br>

  <h1>Disability and ADD</h1>

  <p>
    The disabled are not the diseased, nor the captives.<br>
They also have their special powers and vivid lives.<br>
The people who are hearing and speech impaired,<br>
Have expressions through sign language and hearing aid.<br>
Who have lost the eye sights, have some supernal visions,<br>
Though some have barriers, don’t stop their contributions,<br>
Through unique creations, some earn names and fames,<br>
Autistic people may show queer funs and unique games.<br>
When mania worsens crossing the limits, have little value,<br>
If we learn lessons from them, will gain more psychic clue;<br>
When the limbs are amputated, they are the handicapped,<br>
Having faced fatal accidents, become physically retarded.<br>
There are some hindrances in the people’s conscience<br>
That meanness of minds knows nothing only the pence.<br>
So-called ‘conscience disability’, are bar to development<br>
We have to fight fiercely against all ill motives to prevent.<br>
Non-disabled people should change their cynic attitudes;<br>
Then we will find the actual reductions in the class feuds.<br>
When the others will be very much disability-sensitive<br>
Then the disabled people will have many things to give.<br>
ADD has built their capabilities in a befitting manner,<br>
It has brought them under one and the safer banner.<br>
They have regained their lives, full of tights and fights,<br>
And have promoted themselves, in all levels of rights.<br>
Meetings, workshops, exposures, focused discussions,<br>
Seminar, convention and subject based training sessions.<br>
Advocacies, networking at all levels going in full swing,<br>
Disabled are crossing the limitless borders like Boeing.<br>
Prevalent dissemination of ideas via rigorous campaigns,<br>
Sharing experience, demonstrations through human chains;<br>
Manifold awareness raisings going for access and inclusion,<br>
Those are the ADD’s ideal missions to achieve the vision.<br>
