    <h3>Diabolical Attack</h3>

    <p>
        Aleya! Aleya! at my repeated calling by her nick name, she opened her eyes, looked <br>
blank on my face with exhausted eyes but did not say anything. I called her again 
and again and said Aleya! I have come to see you. She muttered something which <br>
I heard somehow nodding my head towards her mouth. Mostu, “I have not thought of
your coming to visit me”, said she. She further said, “This is a cruelty of my fate<br>
which was destined for me”. I told her, “Have patience and keep deep faith in
Almighty Allah. We have nothing to do. What is lotted by Him that must come to<br>
pass.” A serene but holy smile spread over her sullen face which I thought, as if
expressed as a sign of gratefulness to the Almighty as well as to me at the eve of my<br>
visit.
Aleya was one of my classmates from last class of primary school to college, best
among others girls in the class in respect of jolly mind and social mixing. She was<br>
then studying with us in the first year of intermediate, commerce class. Informed by
one of my bosom friends, Nazu that Aleya had got a serious injury on her head; we <br>
went to their house because I took it to be a duty to visit her.
On going there, we, the two friends, found her lying unconscious on the bed<br>
surrounded by her kiths and kins of various ages. Her old mother was making air
with a palm-leaf fan on her head. Conveying salam to Aleya’s mother and others, we<br>
introduced ourselves and took our seats at the head side of Aleya. Out of deep
feelings and emotions, I took fan from her mother and began to pass.<br>
On enquiry, I come to know from her younger sister who was also with Aleya at the
time of occurrence. She expounded everything to us. Last week, they went to their<br>
village house for spending their weekend and some holidays. At the dead of night of
the day of occurrence, while they were asleep deeply, a gang of miscreants firstly<br>
knocked at the door. They knocked and knocked and last of all broke into the room
which Aleya and her younger sister were staying at night. They were panicked and<br>
screamed but all were in vain. However, the miscreants simultaneously entered into
the room, swooped down their all belongings including some moneys. Being not<br>
satisfied with these things, the lewd persons wanted to satisfy their ill motives on
Aleya. With that end in view, they scuffled and at one stage tried to kidnap her by
applying physical forces. Seeing this kind of vicious and heinous acts by the ruffians,
her younger sister went out the room, cried loudly out of severe fear. Having afraid of
being caught red handed, because by that time all the inhabitants of the houses
arose, one of the lewd persons hurt Aleya on her head with a big bill hook. She
razed down to the ground getting a heavy hurt which made deep wound on her head
that might cause her instantaneous death if it had been made in the middle of the
head. There was much bloodshed from her head and the floor became all gory with
red blood which was like a turf of red carpet. She fell into the deep swoon
instantaneously.
While hearing such kinds of brutal acts of barbarity of the rowdies on the helpless
girls, this filled my mind with great pathos, resentments and wraths. Gradually our

staying at that house was being come to a close, Aleya told in a very low broken
voice, “Mostu, would I be able to study further and attend to my classes normally”?
Hearing this rueful assertion, I turned my eyes towards her gloomy face and assured
her saying, “Don’t think much of your injury; you are recovering. Try to get
consolation as if nothing has happened so harmful. Your injury is not such
dangerous now as may cause any mortal effect. Follow the doctor in taking
medicines &amp; rests and not to talk too much. I hope that you would be cured in a short
time and be able to continue your studies and classes as before”.
At the time of departing, I noticed that there were scratches on her ears which were
the signs of the butcherly wrenching of the ruffians giving no respite of untying her
eardrops. All the time while I was on the way to my home with my friend Nazu,
thought over the heinous acts of the so-called ill-doers and criminals of the society
who in any fashion cannot claim themselves to be the sharers of the modern civilized
society being the inhabitants of the last half of the 20 th century.

    <h3>Ingratitude</h3>
<p>
    During my HSC examination, I experienced bitterly an unforgettable ingratitude in a
girl friend of mine which made me understand the real disposition of some of the
women in general though generalization of this kind of disposition might not be
equally applicable for all women. The alleged girl friend was my classmate from the
last class of primary education at school to this college at which this examination
was being held. Having considered all of her manners and behaviors expressed in
her recklessly roaming hither and thither, loudly talking with some one either for little
or no reasons, she may be called a jolly minded and free mixer girl with anyone else.
It is mentionable here that I had always been a bit shy in my nature even being a boy
and an unasked for conversation with a woman especially with a girl made me very
coy.
After appearing at the ‘Banking’ examination, I came out of the hall. I startled at the
sudden greetings of a womanly voice and turned my eyes in that direction. I found
her coming to me, she stood by the very near to me and began to say something. I
felt ashamed amongst the other students at her close familiarity and physical vicinity
of her standing position. Having observed this situation, the students nearby goggled
to each other’s face which did not escape my ever vigilant eyes. I told her, “Finish
your talking as fast as possible”. She asked expressing her keen desire, “Will you
keep a wish of mine?” I promptly asked “What do you mean by your wish”? She said,
“I wish to sit by the side of you at the time of my next two examinations. It is
mentionable that the papers of next two examinations were ‘Bookkeeping and
Accountancy’. I asked, “How will it be possible for you to sit by my side, because
your sit is in another room.” She said in the voice choked with feelings, “I shall make
all arrangements for that; don’t think of it”. Thinking it to be an impossible task, I
assured her of making a room for her in a vacant seat by my side. In sooth, I was in
utter ignorance about the unfathomable power of the woman folk especially of a
young girl like her in convincing the minds of the so called men.
At dusk, I came home with a mind full of apprehensive feelings and uneasiness. The
thinking about her at intervals in my readings at that evening put me in a restless
situation. However, I appeared the college sitting for the examination at the specific
time for Bookkeeping. As ill luck would have it, I was informed by one of my class
friends appearing at the examination that our next two imminent examinations had
been declared to be held in the big hall room by the order of the Principal of the
college. Situations having been turned in such a way; actually her fortune was made
and her desire was going to be fulfilled at the cost of my valuable moments in the
examination hours i.e. I would be disturbed constantly at intervals.
On entering the room, I was accosted by that very girl friend and was shown the
room to sit at the same bench. I was terribly perplexed at her sudden unexpected
greetings and showing the seat at the same bench for I could not say ‘no’ to her
being the long-run class friend. A shade of deep thought clouded my face within a
moment thinking within myself, “How shall I be able to attend the examination

peacefully sitting by the very near side of the talkative flattering girl who will not
spare any moment in disturbing me”. One of my intimate friends for whom I was
waiting at last came into the examination hall. I consulted with him discussing about
all the matters within a short time and chose to sit at the next bench of the girl friend
instead of sitting in the same bench of her. I was compelled to sit there out of
courtesy and humanitarian grounds. Besides the above, there was another reason
i.e. while we, the promoters undertook a risk of publishing a Journal named “Ulka”
from Bagerhat town in 1976; she actively participated in publishing that journal with
necessary monetary contributions. Thinking as above, I could not change that seat at
the request of other friend also.

By this time, the invigilators came in with the scripts and questions. The bell rang
and my mind also began to beat fast with unknown fears of being disturbed. Scripts
and questions were distributed among the students duly. Then I looked at the girl,
even she was hesitating to write down the particulars of the subject on the front page
of the script and asked/looked at my script.
I began at first doing the sums, the girls also did so. In dong bookkeeping sums, one
should be careful in putting the right items in the right sides – either debits or credits.
The girl put some items in some places where those were not applicable. For which
the sums would not be correct in any way. On detecting the wrongs by me, she
enquired about that, some other correct treatments and some other possible doubtful
items for being more doubtless. For doing some of the other sums, she copied from
my script also. I was over-sure that but for my help, she would not be able to put
right answers of major sums of the questions. The shrewd girl being dissatisfied with
my answers sometimes, kept engaged herself in talking with a distant friend who
was more or less dependent on me in clearing this subject before the examinations
held. To tell the truth, the two were of two diverse sides of me and their constant
talking did me much wrongs in doing the sums properly. She asked me answers of
questions repeatedly, besides she copied many theoretical short answers hearing
from me. The most bothering matter was the constant talking and calling me and my
other friend by names frequently which made me forgot of some important points of
answers of the questions which I could not recollect in the hall at all.
Some days elapsed after that examinations. It was come to my ears that the girl had
said to some of my friends that Mostu had not helped me in the examination hall in
Bookkeeping and Accountancy subjects as was expected by me. To my utter
surprise, I thought “How may it be possible for her to spread allegations upon me
denying the fact that occurred”? This kind of ingratitude troubled my mind very
profoundly.
